# Book List React Application

## Overview

Building upon the previous React application, this version introduces advanced React component concepts including class components, functional components, pure components, and higher-order components (HOC). The application's structure has been enhanced for modularity and performance optimization.

## Features

- **Class Component**: The `BookList` component has been converted to a class component to utilize React's class component features.
- **Functional Component**: A new `BookDetail` functional component has been created for rendering the details of each book.
- **Pure Component**: The `Book` component has been refactored to a pure component to ensure it only updates when its props change.
- **Higher-Order Component**: A `WithLogging` HOC has been implemented to add console logging functionality to the `BookList` component, demonstrating the use of HOCs for cross-cutting concerns.
