Problem Name:
Find Peak Element

Problem Statement:
A peak element in an array is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array nums, where nums[i] â‰  nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index. The array may contain multiple peaks; in that case, return the index of any peak element.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer n, representing the size of the array nums.

The next line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of nums.

The first line contains space-separated integers representing the elements of the sorted array. The second line contains a single integer representing the target value.

Output Format:
An integer representing the index of any peak element.

Test Case 1:
Sample Input: 6 1 2 1 3 5 6 4

Sample Output: 1

Test Case 2:
Sample input: 4 1 2 3 4 5

Sample output: 4

Level: Easy
Hints:
Consider using the binary search approach to find the peak element efficiently. Analyze the relationship between a mid element and its adjacent elements to determine the direction to move towards the peak.

Carefully handle the boundary conditions to avoid index out of bounds errors. Think about how the binary search can be adapted to find a peak element in the array.

Approach:
Read the input values from the user. 
Implement a binary search approach to find the peak element: 
Initialize the start and end variables as 0 and the length of nums minus 1,
 respectively. While start is less than or equal to end:
  Calculate the middle value as (start + end) / 2. If the middle element is greater than both 
  its adjacent elements (nums[middle] > nums[middle - 1] and nums[middle] > nums[middle + 1]), 
  return the middle index as a peak element. If the middle element is smaller 
  than its next element (nums[middle] < nums[middle + 1]), update the start variable to middle + 1 
  to search in the increasing part of the array. Otherwise, update the end variable to middle - 1 
  to search in the decreasing part of the array. Return -1 if no peak element is found.

function findPeakElement(nums) {
  let start = 0;
  let end = nums.length - 1;

  while (start <= end) {
    let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);

    if (
      (mid === 0 || nums[mid] > nums[mid - 1]) &&
      (mid === nums.length - 1 || nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1])
    ) {
      return mid;
    } else if (mid < nums.length - 1 && nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) {
      start = mid + 1;
    } else {
      end = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1; // This line will never be reached given the problem constraints.
}

// Test cases
console.log(findPeakElement([1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4])); // Expected output: 5 (or 1)
console.log(findPeakElement([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Expected output: 4
